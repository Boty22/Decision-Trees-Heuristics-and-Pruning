# Decision Trees Heuristics and Prunning
## Heuristics in a Decision Tree
How do we decide which elements go to the left and which to the right hand of a node in a decision tree? Heuritics are quatified guides to decide how to classify data. 

### Information Gain Heuritic
### Variance Impurity Heuristic

## Regularization with Prunnig
Prunning is a method to regularize a deciion tree, therefore avoid overfitting. As a result the model will generalize better

## Printing a Decision tree

## Key points
* The implementation is recursive because of the nature of the problem.
